## Economic Input-Output Assessment Model
```
```

### Objectives

> *To explore the total impact on chosen sectors and multipliers in term of changes in output and value-added*

### Data Included

> Several datasets are identified for this impact study. 

> **Employment** = *Total Employments in ('000) by Year*

> **GDP** = *Total GDP per sectors by Year in (RM mil)*

> **Output Multiplier** = *Output Multiplier for Sectors provided by DOSM Malaysia*

> **Value Added Multiplier** = *Value-added Multiplier for Sectors provided by DOSM Malaysia*


### Calculation

#### Initial Changes (Worker Productivity Impairment)

> **Initial Changes** = *GDP* * *Workers Affected* * *(Period of Impairment / 365)* 

#### Changes in Output (Direct + Indirect + Induced)

> **Direct Impact** = *Output Direct Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*

> **Indirect Impact** = *Output Indirect Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*

> **Induced Impact** = *Output Induced Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*


#### Changes in Value-Added (Direct + Indirect + Induced)

> **Value Added Direct Impact** = *Value Added Direct Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*

> **Value Added Indirect Impact** = *Value Added Indirect Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*

> **Value Added Induced Impact** = *Value Added Induced Multiplier* * *Initial Changes*
